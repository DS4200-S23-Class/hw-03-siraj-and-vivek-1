            <h4>Channels:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Position on map:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The locations of outlined shapes on the map represent each state. This channel is necessary to see how each
                        state would have voted regionally in the US.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Color (Hue):</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The colors of each state represent the political party that would have won that state in the presidential election.
                        This is an effective channel because red and blue are starkly contrasting and culturally associated with the Republican
                        and Democratic parties.
                    </li>

                <li>Shape of state:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Along with the position, the state's outline on the map is necessary to accurately portray the expected outcome of the election
                        regionally in the US.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Size (area) of state:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Along with position and shape, the size of a state is an important proxy to understand the representation of the Republican and Democratic
                        parties geographically in the US (in this simulated model).

                    <li>Red/Blue stripes: this encodes specifically Nebraska, which would have split its 5 electoral votes (4 Republican, 1 Democratic).</li>

            <h2>Baseball ball motion trajectories</h2>
            <h4>Marks:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Hexagonal points</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Channels:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Color
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hue: Uses a divergent color hue scale from purple to orange to represent how far above or below average LWTS a hit ball was.</li>
                        <li>Saturation: partly because the mean scoring value is encoded with white, there is a natural saturation gradient to represent
                            the intensity of how above or below average a given ball was.
                        </li>
                        <li>This was a good choice because it implicitly communicates (a) intensity of distance from the average and (b) whether or not a ball
                            was above or below average.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Position on the graph</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>X-position: The further to the right a point is, the greater its exit velocity. This was a good choice because it follows the
                            convention that speed and distance increase from left to right.
                        </li>
                        <li>Y-position: Represents the launch angle of the baseball. This is a decent choice of representation, it's slightly unintuitive
                            though because it's less conventional to think of homeplate on the "right." This encoding could have benefitted from flipping the X and
                            Y axis, so that the angle (-50 to 50 degrees) is rendered with respect to baseball's reference point of home plate being on the bottom.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            <h4>Colormap:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Divergent
                    <ul>
                        <li>The divergent colormap represents how far above or below average the score for that specific hit was. It was a good choice of representation
                            because it conveys distance from mean and relative success of the hit quickly and easily. The color map has endpoints in orange and purple with a midpoint of white.

                    <li>The color represents the gender identity of employees.</li>
                    <li>This is a good mapping choice because pink and blue are typically associated with the male and female genders. Using these colors make it easy for users to understand what the graph is trying to convey.
